          <p class="description">
            An IT budget is basically the money set aside to keep your tech
            running smoothly. Think of it like running a household—you need to
            plan for groceries (hardware), rent (software services), and
            unexpected repairs (cybersecurity and training). Without a budget,
            your systems can fall apart fast.

              What Goes Into an IT Budget? Hardware: Laptops, routers, servers,
              backup power supplies (especially important where electricity is
              unreliable). Software: Operating systems, business tools like
              Microsoft 365 or Adobe, or industry-specific platforms. Cloud
              Storage & Hosting: Services like AWS or Azure—used for data
              backups, website hosting, and app storage. Training & Development:
              So your team doesn’t fall behind the tech curve. Cybersecurity:
              Firewalls, secure logins, and regular system updates to keep
              hackers out.

          <h2 class="title">Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Cybersecurity means protecting your digital life—from emails and
            passwords to customer data and company secrets. And in today’s
            world, one careless click can bring down an entire network.

              Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication: Don’t just use
              "123456" and hope for the best. Staff Training: Teach people what
              to look out for—like sketchy links or suspicious email
              attachments. Firewall & Antivirus: These are like digital guards
              protecting your system from invaders. Regular Backups: If things
              go south, you don’t want to lose all your data.`

          <h2 class="title">Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like storage,
            servers, databases, and software—over the internet (“the cloud”)
            instead of relying on local machines or data centers.

              Why It Matters in Africa: Cost-effective: No need for expensive
              hardware. You pay for what you use. Scalable: Start small and grow
              fast—perfect for startups and SMEs. Accessible: Enables remote
              work, online education, and digital services even in rural areas.
              Reliable: Cloud providers offer robust security and backup
              solutions, which is crucial in regions with unstable power and
              internet.

            Digital transformation is the broader shift of using digital
            technologies to change how organizations operate and deliver value.
            It’s not just about tech—it’s about mindset, strategy, and culture.

              Education: E-learning platforms are expanding access to quality
              education. Finance: Mobile money (like M-Pesa) has revolutionized
              banking in East Africa. Agriculture: Apps help farmers access
              weather forecasts, market prices, and digital payments.
              Governance: E-government services reduce bureaucracy and improve
              transparency.
